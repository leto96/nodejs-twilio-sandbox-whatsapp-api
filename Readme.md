# Example using Twilio WhatsApp API with NodeJS

This is a starting exmaple to use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) Sandbox and NodeJS to automaticcaly send/receive and reply WhatsApp messages.

Now it is just for testing and dev, but it can be a start point to use not only the Twilio Sandbox, but [paid Twilio API messages](https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp/pricing/br)

### Sharing

You need to optin in sandbox. Twilio use three number for all sandbox users, so you need top optin by [sending a message](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/quickstart/node#using-pre-provisioned-sandbox-numbers) to one of these numbers.

This links help with who you want to opt-in

```
api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=<Your Sandbox Number>&text=<your URL-encoded sandbox keyword>&1=<lang. Ex:pt_BR>
```

> Obs: The opt-in lasts for 72 hours :warning:
